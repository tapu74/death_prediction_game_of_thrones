This project is developed for fun.


To predict a character alive or dead in Game of thrones series. The dataSet is collected from kaggle.com
Tried to solve the classification problem using some supervised learning algorithm.
The dataSet is divided into two. 
80% of data used for train the models and 20% data for validation.


I donâ€™t know which algorithms would be good to predict the death or alive.

So i evaluate 6 different algorithms:

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Logistic Regression (LR)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Classification and Regression Trees (CART).


After the evaluation among the algorithms , we use the best model to predict on the validation dataSet.

Finally, a classification report has been generated to check the precession, recall, f-score and a confusion matrix of the prediction against the validation dataSet.
